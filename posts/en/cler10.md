# What it can do in ATM
### (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
- Use the prefix. `c!`
  - ~~search manga, anime, reviews... owo~~ soon.
- Join a voice channel and play a text in TTS _(Text to speech)_ (supports Spanish, English, French, Romanian, Korean, Japanese and Portuguese (*・ω・)ﾉ *each with its respective command, en_tts, ko_tts, etc*
- Now with more secrets (｢• ω •)｢ (⌒ω⌒`)
- Bot in Discord.js v12.4.1

# Future plans
- Prettier Website
  - Connect with MariaDB
  - Delete old data and cache
- Support for slash commands
- Eat blue berries
- Play outside

P.S.: If I abandoned this project it's because I got bored or didn't upgrade the bot to a better version of Discord.
