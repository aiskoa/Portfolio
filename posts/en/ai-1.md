# Defending Yourself from AI

&nbsp;

## Disclaimer

I must clarify that these recommendations are for 2024-2026 at the latest. After that time, I have no idea what might happen with the evolution of technology. I also need to make it clear that many of the things I will show are **theoretical** and should not be taken as gospel, as they won't be of much help on their own.

&nbsp;

**! At the end of the article, I will detail sources for consultation, as well as the terms used, and this is only the first part.**

&nbsp;

*Let's begin* :)
I will address certain problems with possible solutions point by point.

---

*   **How do I prevent my voice from being cloned?**
    Answer = Avoid long meetings of more than 3 hours (I know this is bad advice, but let me explain what you can do in this case).

    Cloning a voice requires extensive training to be refined and identical, so it requires a large dataset. While there are already models that need only a minute of dataset, they require significant computing power, which is not cheap.

&nbsp;

*   ðŸ”¹ When you speak, create pauses, relax, think things through. This creates silent spaces that the cloner will have to cut, which makes the task a bit more difficult.

*   ðŸ”¹ Use slang, create an identity for yourself. We all have a character when we speak. You might be known for speaking fast or using complicated terms or words. Even your accent might be quite particular. Therefore, when your voice is cloned, it won't copy the way you say things (we know there are things you would never say or wouldn't say in that way), creating an identity or even imitating an accent makes it difficult to be cloned.

*   ðŸ”¹ Use connectors, filler words, background noise, or stumbles. Speaking with pauses or making mistakes dirties the samples and therefore the dataset. A sample with voice cuts, background noise, or poor expression means it has to be re-recorded. Think of it like when an artist makes a mistake in the studio; the artist has to sing again because the last take wasn't good. Thanks to this, re-recording is expensive.

*   ðŸ”¹ Record your conversations. This will give you a safe space regarding what you say versus what you have never said. It should be noted that doing this must be communicated to others or to the person you are conversing with at the moment, as it is not ethical and can even be a crime.

*   ðŸ”¹ Chill, be safe. Relax and don't worry. If something like this is going to happen, it will happen, and when it does, act calmly, always with a cool head. This way, you will think better and faster. Most of these clonings happen to people who attract public attention: influencers, artists, rulers, journalists. Later we will see what to do if you are one of them.

*   **How do I prevent my image from being cloned?**
    Answer = Like with the voice, it's complicated, as we don't have control over everything that is seen of us or what the world shows of us.

&nbsp;

Try not to take too many photos, especially of your face. If you want to be very strict, don't use a mobile phone or devices with a camera, but this won't work. Therefore, I recommend you get to know yourself. Check how many moles you have, check what things make you different: wrinkles, hair, the shape of your smile, your face. Get to know yourself, look in the mirror and describe yourself. You know how to use your best weapon even with your eyes closed.

I don't know of any tools that can be of help, but you can try using filters. Filters? Yes, filters. This makes it difficult for the algorithm to check your cheekbones and gaze as they distort or even create a false appearance. Pose in original ways in photos (the casual ones).

*   **How do I prevent my iris from being cloned?**
    Answer = Don't sell yourself out, better yet, don't look at a camera.

The iris is not widely used today. It is used to access vaults, safes, and high-value privileged information, which means it is expensive to maintain and manage.
The iris does not represent a danger to a civilian, as few or no procedures require it. If it were to be cloned for some reason, all that is needed is a photo or video of you. It can even be determined by distinction and elimination to the exact color and shape of the eye. So if you want to be cloned, you just have to sell yourself to Worldcoin for 20 USD, and you will be in a database that will be leaked the following month to train NPCs for The Sims.

*   **How do I prevent my fingerprint and digital footprint from being cloned?**
    Answer = It's impossible.

Large entities have control of this data, so this would be the first thing to be cloned. But don't worry, protect your accounts with 2FA, delete cookies, remove unnecessary applications, do not install malicious applications, unknown APKs or EXEs, apply zero trust, use your head.
