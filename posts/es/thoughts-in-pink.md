# Hi there! 👋, this is the first publish as a life blog

&nbsp;

How many times have you heard of me, how many times have you heard the voice in your head, I am here, the sour sound to hurt your ears, to touch the front of your head, the one that makes you ache every morning when you wake up, that annoying noise you hear every day, the one that will kiss you goodbye on the day of your death.

I would like to write mathematical poetry. 💁

&nbsp;

From the sequence:

> 5, 7, 9, 12, 18

Find the sequence after n + 5:

```nx
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 18, 22, 25, 36, 46, 48, 62, 76, 88, 107, 126, 142, 179, 198, 216, 257, 304, 329, 382, 431, 483, 547, 601, 643, 764, 838, 889

```

&nbsp;

Exactly, you only need the answer once, just like you only need to hear that notification once, you live with the constant fear of danger, the constant fear of being left with nothing but me, you are afraid of being part of me, of my eternal embrace, you dread hearing my requiem and being lost in it like a bullet in civil war, you dream of me daily and remember my words as those of a father.
\
You overthink things, over and over again, until you fall under the weight of that mistake made by thinking too much, you want to hear something more than my singing, but there are only small fragments of audio lost in space trying to fit together to form a message, a message that will remain incomplete because of me, the one that takes all your attention, the one that takes all your energy, focus, precision and courage.

```nx
¿Porqué te escucho?

```

> Because part of you needs me.

&nbsp;

```nx
¿Existes o solo estoy loco?

```

> I don't believe in madness, only in the characters of a poorly told story.

&nbsp;

```nx
¿Cuándo dejaré de escucharte?

```

> When the time decides for you, when the time decides for me, when only be you.

&nbsp;

```nx
¿Estaré bien al dejarte?

```

> Just like letting hope die, I will only be part of your story, be'r part of memories and how you have grown stronger so far.

&nbsp;

```nx
¿Y que haré si te necesito, dondé te encontraré nuevamente?

```

> You will find me by reading the beginning of Charles Perrault's "Sleeping Beauty".

&nbsp;

```nx
¿Cómo se que estarás ahí, estarás feliz de verme un vez más?

```

> I will perch under the leaves of a big tree, and I will look into your eyes and say with my mouth only three words, "Siempre estuve aqui".

&nbsp;

```nx
¿Qué pasará si me olvido?

```

> The time will come when everything will make sense, when everything will be silent and there will be no time to listen to me in the same way, my voice will be overshadowed by many other voices and sounds, your mind will be so busy, that when you will hear me in the distance, you will be so happy to hear an old friendship.

&nbsp;

```nx
¿Y si muero sin poder encontrarte, estará bien dejarté?

```

> When the time comes to leave, I will go with you, you will take me by the hand and we will walk together a great green path full of life, with big trees and we will only contemplate the beautiful sky.

&nbsp;

> 13, 2, 18, 6, 17, 12, 20
